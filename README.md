# MyReads Project

This is an app built with React that allows users to search for books and add them to three shelves: "Read", "Currently Reading", or "Want To Read." The app opens on the main page that displays the three shelves and their contents. Users can then navigate to the search page where they can search for other books and add them to the various shelves. Users can change a book's shelf on the main page or search page by clicking a button and selecting the appropriate shelf. The "none" option means the book will not be on any of three shelves and therefore will not be displayed. Changes made to a book's shelf on the main page or search page persist on the other page.

Users can search for books by title, author, or by using the search terms listed in SEARCH_TERMS.md. If old results persist after deleting a query from the search bar then refresh the page and the old results will be gone.

To use this app simply download or clone the repository and then use npm install and npm start on the command line to launch the app.

## TL;DR
To use the app:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the server with `npm start`

```

Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

* [`getAll`](#getall)
* [`update`](#update)
* [`search`](#search)

### `getAll`

Method Signature:

```js
getAll()
```

* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of book objects.
* This collection represents the books currently in the bookshelves in your app.

### `update`

Method Signature:

```js
update(book, shelf)
```

* book: `<Object>` containing at minimum an `id` attribute
* shelf: `<String>` contains one of ["wantToRead", "currentlyReading", "read"]  
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing the response data of the POST request

### `search`

Method Signature:

```js
search(query)
```

* query: `<String>`
* Returns a Promise which resolves to a JSON object containing a collection of a maximum of 20 book objects.
* These books do not know which shelf they are on. They are raw results only. You'll need to make sure that books have the correct state while on the search page.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
